# Utility and Autoload Scripts

This folder is reserved for standalone scripts that define new classes (class_name) or contain shared logic that doesn't belong to a specific scene. This includes utility function libraries (using static func or static var because is Godot 4.1 or newer) and any globally accessible Autoload (Singleton) nodes for systems like dialogue or mission management.
