# Game Levels

This folder contains all level scenes (.tscn) for the game. Each level should reside in its own subdirectory (level_1/, level_2/) to encapsulate all components specific to that area (e.g., unique static meshes, custom geometry, specific lighting setups, or puzzle configurations). The game_world scene manages the instantiation and destruction of these level scenes.
