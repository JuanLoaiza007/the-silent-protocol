# Third-Party Addons

This directory stores all third-party plugins, tools, and non-core scripts used by the project. Following Godot's best practices, this keeps external dependencies isolated. Resources stored here should generally be configured using EditorPlugin.add_custom_type or similar registration methods, making them accessible throughout the editor.
