# Generic Assets

This folder houses non-scene-specific resources used globally across the project, such as generic environment textures, shaders, or materials. Subdirectories categorize these resources for easy access: audio/ (for all music and sound effects), images/ (for UI or placeholder sprites), models/ (for reusable 3D meshes like environmental props), and textures/ (for shared texture resources).
