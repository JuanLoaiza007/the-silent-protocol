# Character Scenes and Assets

This directory contains all scene files (.tscn) and associated scripts/assets specifically related to game entities. Each entity (Player, Villain, NPC, etc.) should have its own dedicated subdirectory. Grouping these resources locally ensures that if a character is reused or modified, all relevant files are easily locatable, adhering to the principle of keeping resources close to their scenes.
