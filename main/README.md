# Project Entry Point

This directory contains the primary scene (main.tscn) and its corresponding script (main.gd). The main.gd script acts as the primary controller, serving as the definitive entry point and the "bird's eye view" of all other data and logic in the program. It typically manages the immediate children: the game_world and the ui (GUI).
